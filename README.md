# FabricSharp

FabricSharp (or Fabric#) is a high-performance permissioned blockchain platform. It improves the performance of [Hyperledger Fabric](https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/fabric) ([on github](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric)) by applying state-of-the-art researches to blockchain systems. 

## Integrated Projects

### FabricSharp based on Hyperledger Fabric 0.6 (fabric-v0.6)

Based on Hyperledger Fabric v0.6 ([release](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/releases/tag/v0.6.0-preview)), this project implements sharding as described in [1].

### FabricSharp based on Hyperledger Fabric 1.0+ (fabric-sharp)

Based on newer versions of Fabric (> v1.0) which adopt the simulate-order-commit execution model, this project implements sharding and other techniques to achieve high throughput. This is a mirror of the master branch of [FabricSharp repository](https://github.com/ooibc88/FabricSharp).

### Hyperledger CaliperSharp

This project \[3] aims to improve [Caliper](https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/caliper) which is Hyperledger's official benchmarking tool.
