Hyperledger fabric Client (HFC) SDK for Node.js
===============================================

The Hyperledger fabric Client (HFC) SDK for Node.js provides a powerful
and easy to use API to interact with a Hyperledger fabric blockchain.
The HFC is designed to be used in the Node.js JavaScript runtime.

Overview and Deep Dive
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  :doc:`Application Developer's Overview <app-overview>` for a
   topological overview of applications and a blockchain.

-  :doc:`Hyperledger fabric Client (HFC) SDK for
   Node.js <node-sdk-indepth>` the Node.js client SDK in more depth

Development Environment Choices
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  *Recommended:*
   :doc:`Fabric-starter-kit <../starter/fabric-starter-kit>` uses
   pre-built docker images for the Node.js client application
   interacting with Hyperledger fabric blockchain. This environment may
   suffice for a majority of Node.js application developers. The
   environment contains a built-in standalone sample ready to go.

-  :doc:`Full Hyperledger fabric development
   environment <app-developer-env-setup>` on how to set up an
   environment for developing chaincode and applications.

**Note:** Only recommended for development of the Hyperledger fabric
Client SDK itself.

Sample Code
^^^^^^^^^^^

-  :doc:`Node.js Standalone Application in
   Vagrant <sample-standalone-app>` for a sample standalone Node.js
   application running in the full development environment within
   Vagrant.

-  :doc:`Node.js Web Application <sample-web-app>` for a sample web
   application and to see how to use the Node.js client SDK for a sample
   web app leveraging the client SDK to interact with a blockchain
   network.
